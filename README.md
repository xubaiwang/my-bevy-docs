# My Bevy Docs

Some documentation on [Bevy](https://bevy.org/) game engine, for my own learning
and reference.

Compared with other Bevy resources, this repo takes a key difference
that it intentionally follows the [_4 types documentation
system_](https://diataxis.fr/), which splits the documentation into four
categories: **Tutorials**, **How-to guides**, **Technical reference** and
**Explanations**.

In Rust, the **Technical reference** is basically fulfilled with the excellent
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs). So this repo will only cover the rest three.
I also plan to split tutorials into separate repositories (`bevy-reengined/*`).
